<h1 class="title">Get Grunting</h1>

<p>Have previously fought with getting Grunt working. Now around Christmas i found a blogg linking to this article: <a href="http://24ways.org/2013/grunt-is-not-weird-and-hard/">Grunt is not weird and hard</a>.</p><p>

</p><p>Wuth some  trial and errors with various node stuff and managing and installing Sass and compass with ease, getting grunt with the artcile previously mentioned was a breeze.</p>

<p>So going from just getting Sass on new and already running projects, I now Grutify them. Getting the Compass and Sass with the JS concatinations and JSHints and Uglift.</p>

<p><strong>The greatest feeling</strong> is when you for the first time can separeate your JS into separate files..!!</p>

<p>The next big GRUNT thing is to get CasperJs and PhantomJS to give me breakpoint screenshots automaticly.. ! (Low
priority)</p>
