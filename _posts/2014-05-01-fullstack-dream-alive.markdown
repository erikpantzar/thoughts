<h1 id="fullstack-dreams-still-here">Fullstack Dreams still here</h1>

<p>Been looking at some AngularJS tutorials, “AngularJS app from the beginning”. Most of the vids I’ve begun watching covers the whole process but most of them use alot of pre-defined modules straight from Visual Studio, and alot of the workflow comes from knowing just wich menu does what. That part really doesn’t appeal to me.</p>

<p>First and foremost I want to know what is going on, and what code gets generated where and why. The other thing is that I want to be OS and plattform independant.</p>

<p>Then I found this <a href="http://mean.io/">Mean.io</a> framework or something, all that MEAN stands for is all of the things that you need to build fullstack applications.</p>

<p>This means that the fullstackJS still is true!</p>

<h3 id="age-wisdom-patience">Age, wisdom &amp; patience</h3>

<p>However I am getting older, and the frustration with Visual Studio and about how slow it is and doing <em>anything</em> takes a long time &amp; the bloated editor.. This might be something I will settle with and start using now with my newly gained year (25).</p>
