<h1 id="finally-got-jekyll-to-work">Finally got Jekyll to work</h1>

<p class="intro">It all started when I read my own post on my former WordPress-site about Grunt, that on the site the
article
was
on, there was also a post about getting into Jekyll and later on getting into Github Pages. Since I'm a big fan of both github and really into these static site generators I decided to have a go.</p>

<h2 id="it-begins">It begins</h2>

<p>I’m quite new to grunt and task-running things through Javascript, but I’m very fond of it, and want to use it on everything.</p>

<h2 id="github-gogo">Github gogo</h2>

<p>After I got my github.io domain working, I decided to drop the old site and the hosting that is hosted on. Transferring files over FTP is so not me (anymore).</p>

<p>I really like to redesign things whilst producing content in the form of blog posts; So the idea of having it directly on Github surely wasn’t hard to start working towards.</p>
