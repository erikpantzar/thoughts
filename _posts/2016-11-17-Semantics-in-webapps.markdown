# Semantics in modern web apps

First of all this will be a three part journey. This journey was trigger by my friend and colleauge with a focus on semantics accessibility and HTML helping and teaching us about the benefits of writing semantic HTML.

And since writing a webapp (angular) I authored custom elements in this context, and questioned myself and asked how to motivate the semantics of my now custom elements. In order to do this I needed to research and find knowledge of this. I split it up into three topics:

This is part of a three part series:

1. [What is semantic HTML?](/thoughts/2016/11/what-is-semantic-html)
2. [What is Web components?](/thoughts/2016/11/what-is-webcomponents)
3. [Are custom-elements semantic HTML?](/thoughts/2016/11/are-custom-elements-semantic)
