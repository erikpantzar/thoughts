<h1 id="ssh-in-and-out-of-a-server">SSH in and out of a server</h1>

<p>The thing I was asked to perform was to change a template in a wordpress theme. This wordpress theme was hosted in (to me) a rather unorthodox enviroment.</p>

<p>I got the IP-adress and root user credentials.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s what I did to acess the server and actually find where the actual files for the site was located:</p>

<h2 id="ssh-into-the-server-and-find-the-site">SSH into the server and find the site</h2>

<pre><code>SSH into the server:
## then i got prompted for password (entered it ofc)
## USE:
ssh &lt;username&gt;@&lt;server&gt;
$ ssh root@12.34.56.78.90

## Next Task: Find where the site is placed
## since it is a wordpress site I know
## there would be a directory called 'wp-content'
$ locate wp-content

## took me to the wp-content folder
</code></pre>

<h2 id="get-access-to-the-files-and-change-them">Get access to the files and change them</h2>

<p>I have worked with linux guys one time before, and knew it is a bit tricky to actually change the files and content wich are hosted in this fashion.</p>

<p>In the past you had to copy the files you wanted to access outside of the server to a users home directory and then sftp/ftp the files from there.</p>

<h2 id="find-your-transfer-window">Find your transfer window</h2>

<p>So to find where I could copy/move the files that I wanted to change, i accessed the same IP with filezilla (the same IP) with SFTP settings.</p>

<p>I then found a folder where I could put my files. To find the location I got to with filezilla, I created a folder and named it &lsquo;temporary_transfer&rsquo;. With having done this I knew a folder I could search for in order to get the location.</p>

<pre><code>$ locate temporary_transfer
</code></pre>

<p>Now all I had to do was copy the wordpress theme files to the temporary location.</p>

<pre><code>## 1. Get to the themes folder for the Wordpress site
$ cd wordpress/wp-content/themes/

## 2. Copy wordpress theme to transfer location
$ cp -R &lt;THEMENAME&gt; /temporary_transfer/
</code></pre>

<h2 id="finishing-up">Finishing up</h2>

<p>Then I downloaded and did what I wanted with the theme files, then uploaded them to the transfer window.</p>

<p>From here you copy the files from the window back to the theme location on the server.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd transfer_window
$ cp -R &lt;EDITED_THEME&gt; /wordpress/wp-content/themes/

## Keep hustling
## Hustle hard
</code></pre>
