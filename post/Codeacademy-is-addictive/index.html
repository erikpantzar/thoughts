<h1 id="codecademy-com-is-super-addictive">Codecademy.com is super addictive</h1>

<p>A friend of mine asked me if i knew PHP (checkout the new php.net site, super hot imo) I quickly wondered why, since he&rsquo;s not at programmer friend of mine.
It turned out he was sitting and going through the classes over at codecademy.com, and currently he was at PHP.
Helped him with some of his tasks, then headed into my own account and kept on brushing on my own PHP lessions.</p>

<h2 id="vanilla-js-so-good">Vanilla JS, So good</h2>

<p>After getting bored with PHP (got stuck) i headed into codecademys vanilla js corner. It is a big thing, the thing about developers not knowing vanilla js but instead requiring jQuery for everything they (we) do. And I&rsquo;ve been meaning to get on the JS train.</p>

<p>All of my idols and people I follow on the internet are also communicating the message and weight of knowing vanilla js. Also alot of new technologies require the knowledge of this. So there is alot of credit and legitimacy to this message.</p>

<h2 id="all-nighter">All nighter</h2>

<p>Ended up sitting longer than I should have in the one seating, one part was the companion on Skype who was struggling with his PHP, an other was the hunger for education and the last the profile scores.</p>
