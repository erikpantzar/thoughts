<h1 id="getting-furter">Getting furter</h1>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve dived into the vanilla JS with <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn" title="Go learn vanilla JS..!!">codeacademys</a> help I refreshed my programming a bit, dusted it off a bit. Now I wanna keep it up and get better!</p>

<h2 id="the-next-one">The next one</h2>

<p>What I want to do going forward is to make a base of people with properties and then present it and compare keys to each other.</p>

<h3 id="stats">Stats</h3>

<p>We got a soccer team wich I would like to keep track of all us players, and setup a base and profile for each player based on my perception of theirs and mine ability on the field.<br>
For example I like to sprint past opponents and maybe do some Ronaldo signature moves, but I can only sprint a limited amount due to my stamina being poor. So my player stat would be something like this:
<pre>
var erik = new Player{
    position: position[4], // attacker
    speed: 80,
    technique: 60,
    stamina: 40,
    // array
    specialty: speciality[2], speciality[3], speciality[4]
};
</pre></p>

<p>Also there would be some string properties like name, position, and profile image or something.</p>

<h2 id="reusability">Reusability</h2>

<p>The most advanced thing I&rsquo;ve thought of is to have some properties collect their values from arrays; In FIFA you can have certain abilites such as &ldquo;Sprinter&rdquo;, &ldquo;Longshot taker&rdquo;, &ldquo;Injury prone&rdquo; or &ldquo;Engine&rdquo;. My way of getting this is to set the value to something out of an array to be able to reuse those properties on other player without worrying about misstyping the value and keep it expandable.</p>

<h2 id="flaws-and-future">Flaws and future</h2>

<p>The thing that this lives on is that it is hardcoded into the JS file (my base of players). What would be nice is for the future to move this to some database structure (gotta expand and learn more of PHP and SQL to get that going.. Codacedemy u got my back?)</p>

<h2 id="look-ma-i-made-it">Look ma, I made it!</h2>

<p>Completed the JS course to a full 100%</p>
